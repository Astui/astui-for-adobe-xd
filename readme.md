Documentation for the API itself - [Astui API Documentation](http://astui.tech/docs/api/#introduction)

Each operation has been extracted into their own module.

**Smart Point Removal** - processed your selection and removes unnecessary points ensuring your artwork is still editable.

**Move Points To Tangencies** - moves points by 90Â°.

**Offset Paths** - allows to offset paths but offset limit and the path type, as well as keeping the original path on the screen. _More information to come_

**Outline Strokes** - creates paths out of strokes on the selection.
